          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
          in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>
        <blockquote>
          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have
          heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
          incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
          life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
          startup. ”</blockquote>

        <blockquote>“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
          for a big company. This was one of the best investments I've made in myself. ”

        <p class="x-large">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them
          and
          learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
        <blockquote>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
          gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
          an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</blockquote>

        <p class="x-large">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
        <blockquote>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
          could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
          100% recommend! ”</blockquote>
