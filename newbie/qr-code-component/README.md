## Overview

In the source code you will find what I consider the bare minimum markup and styles that I came up with to solve the challenge, with the addition of some landmark roles to comply with Accessibility best practices.

### Links

Sandboxes with the solution are available at the following links:

- View it on Repl.it: [Live solution](https://qr-code-solution.emanuelef75.repl.co/)
- View it on Codepen: [Live solution](https://codepen.io/Emanuele-Fabrizio/live/RwqXMVd)

## My process

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- axe-core 4.6.3

### Layout

The basic layout in which the QR code is rendered follows this markup:

```html
<div id="qr-card">
  <div class="container">
    <img class="qr-code">
    <p class="tagline"></p>
    <p class="info"></p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### What I learned

I learned how to use Repl.it to host my solutions even though I had selected Codepen.io at first. I also learned how to center vertically the QR component container using flexbox rules.
Additionally, I enjoyed the fact that the Frontendmentor.io checks the provided solution for accessibility best practices.
