## Overview

In the source code you will find what I consider the bare minimum markup and styles to solve this challenge, with the addition of some landmark roles to comply with Accessibility best practices.

This solution started with a mobile-first approach and it contains responsive adjustment to spacing without modifying font sizes.

## My process

Final testing includes running axe DevTools extension to check for accessibility issues, with best practices option turned on.

Responsive design tested via Responsively app, and Firefox DevTools.

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow
- axe-core 4.10


### What I learned

1. I learned to simplify the number of containers needed to achieve a "centered" look for the overall component.
2. I learned to style the `:focus` and `:focus-visible` state of an element and their impact on accessibility.
3. I learned more about the advantages of using the `classList` property to manipulate the `class` attribute of an element.

### Questions

1. I would like to see how others implemented the radio buttons while maintaining full keyboard functionality.
