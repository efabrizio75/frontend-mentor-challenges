## Overview

In the source code you will find what I consider the bare minimum markup and styles to solve this challenge, with the addition of some landmark roles to comply with Accessibility best practices.

## My process

Final testing includes running axe DevTools extension to check for accessibility issues, with best practices option turned on.

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow
- axe-core 4.10

### Layout

The basic layout in which the product card component is rendered is this:

```html
<div id="blog-entry-preview">
  <div class="container">
    <img class="visual" ... />
    <ul class="tags">
      <li class="extra-small">...</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="timestamp extra-small">Published <time>21 Dec 2023</time></p>
    <h1>
    <p class="blurb small">
    <div class="authors">
      <p class="author-bio small"><img class="avatar" .../>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### What I learned

1. This was a really simple challenge, but it was still a good opportunity to think about ways to avoid code duplication in the future.
2. I think most of my learning this time was on the way to use Figma to discover where all design information is kept ðŸ˜ƒ
