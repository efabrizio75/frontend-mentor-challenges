## Overview

In the source code you will find what I consider the bare minimum markup and styles to solve this challenge, with the addition of some landmark roles to comply with Accessibility best practices.

This solution started with a mobile-first approach and it contains responsive adjustment to spacing without modifying font sizes.

### Layout

The basic layout of the entire sections containing cards is this:

```html
 <div id="testimonials-section">
  <section class="testimonial">
    <div class="avatar-container">
      <img class="avatar" ... />
      <h2 />
      <h3 class="smaller" />
    </div>
    <p class="x-large" />
    <blockquote />
  </section>
</div>
```
